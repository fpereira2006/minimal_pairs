I heard a weird rumor
The river is rising
The car on that street is red
Return it right away
I need some water
That's a better idea
Richard lives in the city
Can I have a little more butter
Traitor, litter, waited
His mother dropped a tooth in the sink
I handed them a thick blanket for the trip
She told those kids to walk through the hallway quietly
He'd rather go hiking on Thursday
Though it was cold, they said thanks and kept walking
She wore a white dress to visit the vet
They drank wine while watching the volcano erupt
We watched the sunset from a window with an amazing view
We heard a voice whisper in the woods
The kids waved from the wagon near the small village
She laughed, then called her friend, and finally waited outside
They cleaned the garage after they needed supplies and helped neighbors
We smiled the whole time because we invited everyone and danced all night
We watched the replay before he opened the window and added a comment
I decided to stay home. I cooked some pasta. I loved the quiet evening
I see the lions at the zoo every summer
She passes by and plays the piano beautifully
The ice melted in front of my eyes
The bus made a loud buzz when it stopped
Please face forward and raise your hand if you know the answer
Please sit in the ship before we leave
The sun warmed the shore all day
They passed the store and washed their hands outside
She said hello while holding her new shoes
The bus stopped near the shop at noon
She sells seashells by the seashore
She said yes and ate some jam on toast
I told a joke about a yellow bird
He mowed the yard and drank fresh juice
The young girl met a judge at the courthouse
After a big yawn, he pulled on his jeans
